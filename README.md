## Prerequisites
---
Before doing the actual work, you first need to choose the IDE you want to use and the website you want to publish. It is recommended to use typora as the IDE here. If you have no previous development experience, the online markdown editor is also a good one. For websites, you can choose GitHub or Codeberg to publish your content.

If you choose to use an online markdown editor, go to [this](https://markdown-editor.github.io/ "this") website.

If you choose to use typora as a development tool, first, go to the official website to [download](https://typora.io/ "download") the installation package.

Installation
Open the downloaded typora installation package, as shown.

Click Install, and you can use it after the installation is complete.

Note：If you have used other IDEs before, such as Visual Studio Code, typora provides a plugin that allows you to program using markdown without switching programming IDE. The specific configuration method is [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-typora "here").

After completing the IDE setup, register for a GitHub or Codeberg account, and then proceed to the next step.

4.After creating your GitHub repository, you need to start rearranging your resume in markdown format. This requires you to use typora to complete. When editing, try to use some easy-to-understand methods, and make notes where necessary to make possible future modifications easier, as Etter mentioned in the book "use lightweight markup".

5.After you finish editing your resume, you need to upload your resume to your GitHub homepage. According to Etter's "Don't duplicate" principle, try to classify the files required for the resume into different files.

<pre>Note: If you used a resume template, make sure you cite it in your file to avoid copyright issues.</pre>

6.Add the content that needs to be supplemented to the readme document.

7. After creating your resume page, use static web page generation, such as jekyll, to back up your website. Static web pages can make it easier for you to find potential problems in future modifications.
